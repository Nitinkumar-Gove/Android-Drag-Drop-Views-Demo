# Drag-Drop-Views-Demo

This is a simple demo of how drag-drop animation can be applied to views. In this project, the drag-drop animation/effect is demonstrated on two textboxes. You can replace these views with any others available.

Moreover, this demo also demonstrates how other views present in the activity can respond to these drag-drop events. Collectively both these operations can be used to create really awesome user experiences in your app.
